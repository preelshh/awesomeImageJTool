1. Go to ImageJ GUI on your computer
2. Repeat the steps you see in PipelineManager which should be
	i. Binarize the image
	ii. Enhance contrast and apply auto-threshold (Li) to the image
	iii. Watershed (Make sure image is binary) 
	iv. Potentially despeckle, open, erode etc. 
3. Go to MorphoLibJ Plugin and select ConnectedComponentsLabeling
4. Go to MorphoLibJ Plugin and select Analyze Regions (make sure number of particle is overlayed on the resulting Analyze Regions generated image)
5. Save the Results.csv file on your computer
6. (Super Fun Exciting Portion): Hand label (probably not every but as many as you can). You can do this by recording the index of each particle you see into a list of indices PER class. (Please look at Notebooks/DataParsing724 to e  exactly this process is done)
7. Create a dataframe for each class (dfA,dfB,...). Make sure there exists a column 'particle_type' as this is our output variable
